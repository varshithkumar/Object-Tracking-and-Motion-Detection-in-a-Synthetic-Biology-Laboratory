# Object-Tracking-and-Motion-Detection-in-a-Synthetic-Biology-Laboratory
We are implementing an object tracking and motion detection system to keep a record of the protocols and procedures carried out in the synthetic biology lab. This system in combination with Neural Talk trained with the dataset of images appropriate for laboratory protocols such as pipettes and workbenches can track specific objects and capture the experimental procedures carried out in the wetlab accurately. Neuraltalk is a deep learning project implemented by Andrej Karpathy and Li Fei Fei at Stanford University.
